Requirements of flow system software:

- System monitoring:
    - Real time updates of reactor temperature, pump flow rates, pump pressure,
    - Set max volume that we can dispense from pump A, B for R/S
    - Monitor total volume dispensed, current reacto

- Execute experiments / routines:
    - Ramp residence time

- We can predict the 


time_min,
reactor_volume_mL, 
volume_dispensed_mL,
flow_rate_mL_per_min,
